# Wallet
This project is a simple RESTful API for managing digital wallets, built with Python and Flask. It allows users to create wallets, deposit and withdraw funds, and view transaction histories. Data is stored in a local JSON file, and the API includes input validation, error handling, and CORS support for cross-origin requests.
